# Office Status Stream Deck Plugin

## Description

This plugin is used in conjunction with the ['Office Status app'](https://github.com/mattboston/officestatus), a Raspberry Pi W, and a Pimoroni Unicorn Hat.  It allows you to set the status by assigning a button on your Stream Deck.

## TBD

Lots to add and cleanup here.
